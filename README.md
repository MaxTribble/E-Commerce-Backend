## Description

I made this application as a mock-up for an ecommerce back-end. I really wanted to practice my skill with databases and build a potentially useful ecommerce program. It is a solid start for keeping tack of products. I learned a lot about relationship routes and how to pull multiple sets of data with one get requests.

## Installation and Usage

The installation is in line with many similar back-end programs. Putting "npm i" in the terminal will download all required packages. From there, put "node server" in the terminal to get the server running. The next portion will require insomnia for easy viewing of the database. 

## Credits

The main resource I used for creating this was the DU bootcamp class work as well as W3schools.com for documentation.
